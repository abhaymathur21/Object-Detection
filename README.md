# Object-Detection
Object Detection in images and in real-time using the best Machine Learning models available.

I did thorough research on which models are the most accurate in this domain and tested each of them out.

- RTDETR is the most accurate model available currently
- YOLOv8 is almost as accurate and works at a higher FPS
